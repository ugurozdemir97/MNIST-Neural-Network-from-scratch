# MNIST-Neural-Network-from-scratch
A neural network made with only Numpy arrays that learns to read hand written numbers.
You need to download MNIST data and paste in Data folder! Since the data set is too heavy I can't upload it here.

The program checks if there is a trained neural network first and use it if there is any. I've trained the neural networks a couple times and upload them, in TrainedWeights folder. You can delete them if you want to train the neural network yourself. All you need to do is to download MNIST digit dataset and paste in Data folder. Then run "Neural Network.py". Then the program will iterate through the dataset and learn how to read the digits. After the training ends, you will see what is the success rate, how good is your AI. 

At the end of the training, the program will show 10 example data and predictions.

I've got so much help from YouTube when writing this app and there are some parts that I didn't understand well, but I've tried to write the explanations as clean as possible.
